# Python-Pong-Game
My Python Pong is a classic two-player arcade game with dynamic gameplay. Players control paddles to bounce a moving ball, while the ballâ€™s speed increases after each hit. The game tracks scores, displays a win message, supports keyboard controls, and provides optional sound effects for an immersive, offline experience.
